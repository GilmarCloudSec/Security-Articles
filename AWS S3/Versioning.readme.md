### **S3 Versioning**
- **Multiple Versions**: Allows multiple versions of an object in S3.
- **MFA**: Supports Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for enhanced security.
- **Object Recovery**: Helps recover objects from accidental deletion or overwriting.
- **Delete Marker**: When versioning is enabled, deleting an object hides it (via a delete marker). To restore, remove the delete marker.
