### Key Points for S3 PreSigned URLs:

- **Purpose**: S3 PreSigned URLs allow secure sharing of content from an S3 bucket by generating a temporary URL.
- **Expiration**: The URL is valid for a specified period, after which it automatically expires.
- **Access Dependency**: If the AWS user who generated the PreSigned URL loses access to the bucket, the PreSigned URL becomes invalid, even if its expiration time hasn't been reached.
