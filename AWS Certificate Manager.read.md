# Certificate Manager (ACM)

ACM (AWS Certificate Manager) provides a way to establish secure communication over the internet using public certificates or within an internal network using private certificates.

## Key Features

- **Certificate Generation and Import**: 
  - You can generate or import TLS/SSL certificates.
  - Certificates generated by ACM automatically renew.
  - For imported certificates, you are responsible for renewal and importing the updated versions to ACM.

- **Deployment**: 
  - Certificates can only be deployed to supported services, including:
    - CloudFront
    - Elastic Load Balancer
    - Cognito
    - API Gateway
    - CloudFormation
    - Network Firewall

- **Regional Considerations**: 
  - ACM is a regional service. If you generate or import a certificate in a specific region, it cannot be used in another region.
  - For example, to use a certificate with an Application Load Balancer (ALB) in the **us-west-2** region, you must have a corresponding certificate in ACM for that region.

- **CloudFront Requirement**: 
  - When using ACM with CloudFront, the ACM certificate must be created in the **us-east-1** (N. Virginia) region.
