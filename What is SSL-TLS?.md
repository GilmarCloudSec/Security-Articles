Secure Socket Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) are cryptographic protocols that ensure secure communication over the internet. 

They protect web traffic, email, instant messaging, and other types of online communication. By using a combination of symmetric and asymmetric encryption, SSL and TLS secure data transmissions and prevent unauthorized interception.
