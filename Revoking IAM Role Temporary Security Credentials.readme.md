### Revoking IAM Role Temporary Security Credentials

**Understanding the Problem:**  
Leaked IAM role temporary security credentials pose a significant security risk, allowing unauthorized access to AWS resources and leading to potential data breaches and other incidents.

**Evaluating Proposed Solutions:**  
- **Deleting the Role:** Effective but may disrupt operations if the role is widely used.
- **Modifying Trust or Permission Policies:** Changes wonâ€™t affect existing credentials and may unintentionally impact legitimate users.

**Effective Solution:**  
**Inline Policy with Time-Based Denial**  
Creating an inline policy with a time-based denial condition is an effective strategy. This policy denies access to all actions for tokens issued before a specific time, effectively revoking leaked credentials.

The policy denies access to all actions on all resources for any user whose authentication token was issued before **5:03:38.409 PM UTC on September 26, 2024**:

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Deny",
            "Action": "*",
            "Resource": "*",
            "Condition": {
                "DateLessThan": {
                    "aws:TokenIssueTime": "2024-09-26T17:03:38.409Z"
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

**Conclusion:**  
By implementing a time-based denial policy along with proactive security measures, you can effectively mitigate the risks associated with leaked IAM role credentials. Ensure to tailor your approach to fit your specific security requirements and incident response procedures.
